# Egg-grade-detection

This is an image-based egg grade prediction system utilizing computer vision techniques to accurately categorize eggs into different grades, aiming to eliminate human intervention in the egg grading process, improve efficiency, and enhance accuracy in the agriculture and poultry industries.

Skill Set:Knowledge about computer vision, SVM, RF, Decision Tree, GaussianNB.

Output: The final output will be able to accurately detect and categorize egg grades based on visual input, leveraging advanced computer vision techniques. Through image analysis, the system will classify eggs into predefined categories such as small, medium, large, or extra-large, depending on their shape, size, and other visual features.
